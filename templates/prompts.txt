Start with both hands in a "C" shape at chest level, palms facing down.
Move both hands forward and up, keeping the fingers spread, until they meet at chest level.
Spread your fingers wide and separate your hands, moving them away from your body.
Bring your hands back to your chest, palms facing down, in the starting position.

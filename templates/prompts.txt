Start with your dominant hand in a fist at your chest, with your thumb tucked in.
Slowly open your hand, keeping your fingers close together, and extend it straight out in front of you.
Keep your non-dominant hand at your side.
Repeat the sign by bringing your hand back to your chest and repeating the opening and extending motion.
Practice the sign several times to ensure you have the correct handshape, movement, and placement.
